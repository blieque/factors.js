# Factors

Some JavaScript fiddles with numbers and particularly factors.

## Running Them

The scripts are written to run with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). On my machine, I have all but the `factors.js` file made executable, and I run them from the terminal. As long as `factors.js` is in the same directory as the rest, they should be able to find it and work.
